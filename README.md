# CS61A

This is my work on CS61A (Spring 2018 version) of UC Berkeley.

This course covers the basic of programming and introduced the using of several programming languages including Python, Scheme and SQL.

Highlights of the projects (all wrriten in Python):

1. Hog:

    A project of developing a simulator and multiple strategies for a dice game names Hog.    
    Different control statements and higher-order functions are required to run the program.
    
2. Maps:

    A visualization of restaurant ratings by a Voronoi diagram using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset.
    
3. Ants:

    A tower defensive game between the ants and bees.     
    It involves functional and object-oriented programming and testing of a large program. 
    
4. Scheme interpreter:

    An interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language.     
    After implementing basic Scheme features, the Read-Eval-Print Loop components in the interpreter will parse the input, evaluate 
    Scheme expressions (represented in Python) and print the result.
